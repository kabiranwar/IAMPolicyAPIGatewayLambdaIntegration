In AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit), cdk bootstrap is a command that prepares an AWS environment (account and region) for deploying CDK applications. It sets up the necessary resources that the CDK needs to function properly.

What cdk bootstrap Does:
Creates a Staging Bucket – This S3 bucket is used to store assets (such as Lambda code, Docker images, and CloudFormation templates) before deployment.

Creates an IAM Role – A CloudFormation execution role that allows AWS CDK to deploy stacks on your behalf.

Creates an ECR Repository (if needed) – If your application uses Docker images, it will set up an Amazon ECR repository to store them.

Stores Bootstrap Version Information – Tracks the version of the bootstrap stack to ensure compatibility with newer CDK versions.

When Do You Need to Run cdk bootstrap?
When using AWS CDK for the first time in a new AWS account or region.

You van copy the bootstrap template (https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-cli/blob/main/packages/aws-cdk/lib/api/bootstrap/bootstrap-template.yaml) from the aws-cdk-cli GitHub repository or obtain the template with the cdk bootstrap --show-template command
